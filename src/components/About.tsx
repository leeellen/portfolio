                        I am Eunji Lee, a front-end developer who pursues writing code that is easy for anyone to
                        understand and read.

                        If I were to introduce myself a little more, I would say that I am a developer who enjoys three
                        things without being afraid.

                        As for project experience, I have experience building a service administrator from scratch for
                        about 3 years, and I have experience working in shopping malls and events. I have experience
                        working on various projects including platforms.

                        Recently, I have become interested in building 3D environments in a web environment, so I am
                        studying Babylon.js.
